A small set of lineage-restricted transcription factors (_TFs_), termed core regulatory circuitry (_CRC_), control cell identity and malignant transformation. Here, we integrated gene dependency, chromatin architecture and TF perturbation datasets to characterize 31 core TFs in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Contrary to a widely accepted model, we detected a modular CRC structure with hierarchically organized, partially redundant and only sparsely interconnected modules of core TFs controlling distinct genetic programs. Rapid TF degradation followed by measurement of genome-wide transcription rates revealed that core TFs directly regulate dramatically fewer genes than previously assumed. Leukemias carrying KMT2A (MLL) rearrangements depend on the IRF8/MEF2 axis to directly enforce expression of the key oncogenes MYC, HOXA9 and BCL2. Our datasets provide an evolving model of CRC organization in human cells, and a resource for further inquiries into and therapeutic targeting of aberrant transcriptional circuits in cancer.
