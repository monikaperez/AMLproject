# AML methods descriptions

## chipseq analysis

Chipseq analysis was done on raw fastq files, using nextflow's chipseq pipeline on hg38 reference genome. A forked vesion of the pipeline containing additional code to manage run on google cloud and drosophila spike-in was create in __github:jkobject/chipseq__. Chipseqs were a mix of paired end and single end. MACS2 broadpeak mode was used for: "CEBPB", "BRD4", "PU1", "MED1", "SMC1", "IRF2BP2", "CEBPA" and all histone proteins.
A list of samples used can be found in the [chip tracker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yFLjYB1McU530JnLgL0QIMAKIkVl3kl0_LCHje2gk8U), under __Chip_Tracker_JK__ .
Notebooks, functions and versions can be found at __jkobject/AMLproject__.

## differential chipseq

Differential binding of the same protein under two conditions was computed using __MACS2 diffbdgpeak__ mode.
Scaling factors were computed using drosophila spike-in. The [chip tracker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yFLjYB1McU530JnLgL0QIMAKIkVl3kl0_LCHje2gk8U) displays how scaling was computed for each differential chipseq samples.

The scaling values where used to rescale the actual scaling values from __diffbdgpeak__ (see our python function).
Notebooks, functions and versions can be found at __jkobject/AMLproject__.

## merging replicates

We have had variable amount of chipseq replicates.
Some of them were described as bad after QC-ing them on our processing pipeline, using __multiQC__ and visual inspection (see annotations in the [chip tracker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yFLjYB1McU530JnLgL0QIMAKIkVl3kl0_LCHje2gk8U)).

From these we needed to compute a consensus peak profile for each TFs. We created a tool that computes the best consensus from a set of replicates. Using bad/good annotations, overlap information and recovering/reassessing peaks across replicates using the same algorithm as __MACS2__'s.

## rnaseq analysis

For RNAseq analysis, we used the same pipeline as the one used by CCLE (Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia): __STAR__+__RSEM__, with __STAR__ v2.6.1c, __RSEM__ v1.3.0 and __gencode__'s v29 reference gene regions.
we used hg38 reference genome and regions, enriched with ERCC92's v29 reference
Notebooks, functions and versions can be found at __jkobject/AMLproject__.
Results were merged into a dataframe. Genes with no expression or no variance in expression were dropped.

### scaling factors

Scaling factors were computed using our __ERCC__ spike-in. We used __ERCC__'s R dashboard package to get QC on the spike in. We only scaled samples were __ERCC__ displayed a mean scaling of at least 2x higher the standard error.

### differential expression analysis

For differential analysis we used __DESeq2__ v1.26.0. We defined a simple formula of ~ Control + Condition. We used __ERCC__ pseudo genes to rescale, by passing them to __DESeq2__'s `run_estimate_size_factors` control_genes parameter.

## slamseq analysis

slamseq processing was performed by using __slamdunk__, a modified debugged version, that could work on python3, was both single & paired end sequencing. https://github.com/jkobject/slamdunk.com. We then removed genes with either no expression or no variance in both tc count and total count files.

For differential analysis we used __DESeq2__ v1.26.0 on tccounts, taking the total counts as scaling factors. We did so by passing the mean expression of the genes across each experiments to __DESeq2__'s `run_estimate_size_factors` geoMeans parameter. We used __ERCC__ pseudo genes to rescale, by passing them to __DESeq2__'s `run_estimate_size_factors` control_genes parameter

## motif analysis

Motif analysis has been done using __MEME v5.1.1__ and the __HOCOMOCOv11_full_HUMAN_mono__ database of human motifs. the fasta file was a personalized genome of MV411 using hg38 fasta file and  mutations called by __Haplotype Caller__ on __CCLE__'s 30x WGS of MV411.
Motifs were called on MV411 using open region of the genome from our MV411 ATACseq data. Found motifs were merged into our consensus set of peaks from the cobinding matrix, if they were at most 100 bp from the peak.
